# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Machine-Learning---Python
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting the risk of heart disease in individuals based on various health-related features. Early detection and assessment of heart disease risk are crucial for preventive healthcare. This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying potential heart disease cases.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Robust data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of a range of machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, and neural networks for heart disease prediction.
Model Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.
Interactive Web Interface: A user-friendly web-based interface for users to input their health parameters and receive predictions regarding their heart disease risk.
Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow/Keras (for neural networks)
Flask (for the web interface)
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for the frontend)
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (for data handling and visualization)
